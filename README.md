# Aryel's Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects that I've been developing throughout my journey as a backend developer. Here you'll find examples of my work on projects in the fields of data science, process automation, and artificial intelligence.

## About

The goal of this portfolio is to centralize the main projects I have developed and provide a clear overview of my technical skills. Each project includes a brief description, the technologies used and the link to the full repository. It also includes a page to contact me by email.
